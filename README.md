# BulkPDF
## What is BulkPDF?
BulkPDF is a free and easy to use freeware software (Open Source), which allows to automatically fill an existing PDF form with different values. Only a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2007/2010/2013, LibreOffice or OpenOffice Calc) with the desired values is required. [opensource.bulkpdf.de](http://opensource.bulkpdf.de/)
